### Chatbot Car Parking

This project is a complete **Chatbot Car Parking** system, consisting of three main components:

1. **Number Plate Detection**: Detects and extracts vehicle number plates from images using PaddleOCR and Ultralytics.
2. **Backend**: Manages authentication, parking bookings, and serves as an API that connects the frontend and number plate detection system.
3. **Frontend**: Provides a user interface for interacting with the parking system.

---

## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** for the frontend.
- **Python 3.x** for the backend and number plate detection system.
- **MongoDB** for the backend database.

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git https://github.com/alok-ahirrao/Car-Parking-Chatbot.git
cd Car-Parking-Chatbot
```

---

## Part 1: Backend Setup

### 2. Navigate to the Backend Folder

```bash
cd backend
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the backend dependencies using `npm`:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages as defined in `package.json`.

### 4. Run the Backend Server

After installing the dependencies, start the backend server with:

```bash
node app.js
```

The backend server will start, and the API will be available for handling user requests.

---

## Part 2: Frontend Setup

### 5. Navigate to the Frontend Folder

```bash
cd ../frontend
```

### 6. Install Frontend Dependencies

Install the frontend dependencies using `npm`:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the required packages from `package.json`.

### 7. Start the Frontend Application

Once the dependencies are installed, start the frontend application with:

```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## Part 3: Number Plate Detection Setup

### 8. Navigate to the Number Plate Detection Folder

```bash
cd ../number_plate_detector
```

### 9. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Create a virtual environment for the Python-based number plate detection system:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

### 10. Activate the Virtual Environment

- On **Windows**:

```bash
.\myenv\Scripts\activate
```

- On **macOS/Linux**:

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

### 11. Install Python Dependencies

Install the required Python dependencies for the number plate detection system:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 12. Run the Number Plate Detection Application

After setting up the environment and installing dependencies, run the main Python script:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will start the number plate detection service, which will listen for incoming image recognition requests.

## Features

- **Number Plate Detection**: Uses PaddleOCR and Ultralytics to detect and extract vehicle number plates from images.
- **Backend API**: Handles authentication, parking bookings, and number plate recognition through an Express server.
- **Frontend**: Built with React, providing a user-friendly interface to interact with the car parking system.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Backend**: If you encounter issues with the backend, ensure that MongoDB is running and that the `package.json` dependencies are correctly installed.
- **Frontend**: If the frontend doesn’t load, try clearing the `node_modules` and reinstalling dependencies with `npm install`.
- **Number Plate Detection**: If the detection doesn’t work, ensure that the Python dependencies are correctly installed and the virtual environment is activated.
